# Projen Silvermine

Project generator for Silvermine projects built on the [Projen][url-projen] configuration
management framework.

## Usage

Create a directory, and initialize a new Projen project targeting this library
as the source:

```bash
mkdir dir-name && cd dir-name
npx projen new --from projen-silvermine
```

## Publishing New Versions

Note: This should all be replaced by our own release process soon, this is just for
the POC of this project.

Ensure there are no outstanding changes that will be generated by Projen:

```bash
npm i && npx projen
```

Commit any resulting artifact changes, then proceed with the release:

```bash
npx projen bump
```

```bash
npx projen release
```

Publish the tarball to NPM:

```bash
npm publish dist/js/projen-silvermine@version.number
```
