# Projen Silvermine

Project generator for Silvermine projects built on the [Projen][url-projen] configuration
management framework.

## Usage

Create a directory, and initialize a new Projen project targeting this library
as the source:

```bash
mkdir dir-name && cd dir-name
npx projen new --from projen-silvermine
```

### Development Notes

Before committing code, ensure there are no outstanding changes that will be generated by
Projen as a result of your changes:

```bash
npm i && npx projen
```

This is especially important when modifying the project configuration in `.projenrc.ts`.

## Publishing New Versions

Note: This should all be replaced by our own release process soon, this is just for
the POC of this project.

Commit any resulting artifact changes, then proceed with the release:

```bash
npx projen release
```

Tag the release:

```bash
git tag {vX.X.X} && git push origin tags
```

Publish the tarball to NPM:

```bash
npm publish dist/js/projen-silvermine@version.number
```
